# Theoretical Background

## 1. Transmission Line Matrix (TLM) Method

The TLM method is a time-domain numerical technique for solving Maxwell's equations. It discretizes space into a network of transmission lines, where voltage pulses propagate and scatter at nodes.

### Basic Principles

1. **Discretization**: Space is divided into cells of size Î”l
2. **Time stepping**: Each time step Î”t = Î”l/c (CFL condition)
3. **Scattering**: At each node, incident pulses scatter to produce reflected pulses
4. **Connection**: Scattered pulses propagate to adjacent nodes

### 1D TLM Equations

For a shunt node with characteristic impedance Zâ‚€:

**Scattering matrix:**
```
V_r = S Ã— V_i
```

where S is the scattering matrix.

**Connection:**
```
V_left^{n+1}(i) = V_right^n(i+1)
V_right^{n+1}(i) = V_left^n(i-1)
```

## 2. Graphene Conductivity

### Drude Model (Intraband)

The Drude model describes graphene conductivity from intraband transitions:

$$\sigma_{intra}(\omega) = \frac{e^2 E_F}{\pi \hbar^2} \cdot \frac{i}{\omega + i\gamma}$$

where:
- $E_F$ = Fermi energy
- $\gamma = 1/\tau$ = scattering rate
- $\tau$ = relaxation time

### Physical Parameters

| Parameter | Typical Range | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| E_F | 0.1 - 1.0 eV | Controllable via gating |
| Ï„ | 10 - 1000 fs | Depends on sample quality |
| T | 300 K | Temperature |

### DC Conductivity

At zero frequency (Ï‰ â†’ 0):

$$\sigma_{DC} = \frac{e^2 E_F \tau}{\pi \hbar^2}$$

### Plasma Frequency

The characteristic frequency where graphene transitions from metallic to dielectric behavior:

$$\omega_p = \sqrt{\frac{e^2 E_F}{\pi \hbar^2 \tau}}$$

## 3. Optical Response of Graphene Sheet

### Fresnel Coefficients

For a thin conductive sheet at normal incidence between two media with the same impedance:

**Reflection coefficient:**
$$r = \frac{-\sigma Z_0}{2 + \sigma Z_0}$$

**Transmission coefficient:**
$$t = \frac{2}{2 + \sigma Z_0}$$

where $Z_0 = 376.73 \Omega$ is the free-space impedance.

### Power Coefficients

$$R = |r|^2, \quad T = |t|^2, \quad A = 1 - R - T$$

### Maximum Absorption

For a symmetric structure (air-graphene-air), maximum absorption is achieved when:

$$\text{Re}(\sigma) = \frac{2}{Z_0} \approx 5.3 \text{ mS}$$

This gives $A_{max} = 50\%$ (half of incident power).

## 4. TLM Implementation for Graphene

### Resistive Boundary Condition

The graphene sheet is modeled as a resistive boundary at a specific node. The scattering at this node includes the graphene surface impedance:

$$Z_s = \frac{1}{\sigma(\omega)}$$

### Frequency Domain Analysis

1. **Excitation**: Broadband Gaussian pulse
2. **Propagation**: Run TLM for sufficient time steps
3. **FFT**: Transform time signals to frequency domain
4. **Power ratios**: Calculate R, T, A from spectral power

### Numerical Considerations

- **Grid resolution**: Î”l << Î»_min (at least Î»/20)
- **Time steps**: Sufficient for pulse to traverse domain
- **Boundary conditions**: Absorbing (PML) to prevent reflections

## 5. Physical Insights

### Effect of Fermi Energy

- Higher E_F â†’ More free carriers â†’ Higher conductivity
- Higher conductivity â†’ Higher absorption (up to 50%)
- E_F is tunable via electrostatic gating

### Effect of Relaxation Time

- Longer Ï„ â†’ Sharper spectral features
- Shorter Ï„ â†’ Broader absorption band
- Ï„ depends on sample quality and defects

### Frequency Dependence

- Low frequency: High reflection, low transmission
- High frequency: Low reflection, high transmission
- Absorption peak near plasma frequency
